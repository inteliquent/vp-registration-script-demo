# Voice Platform Script Demo
This repository contains information on how to attach a custom call flow Voice API script to a Voyant Phone Number.

# The Script
This script accomplishes the following use-case:
- We receive the inbound Call (LegA) and:
  - Play ringing in the background
  - Then, we Dial out to the SIP Endpoint for legB
    - When the user picks up, its either the voicemail, or a real person, so we ask them to press a Key to accept the call (using TTS)
      - If they press 1, then we join them to the Conference Room
      - If they donâ€™t press 1, then we terminate LegB and stop playing ringback, play the voicemail instructions using TTS, play a Beep, and turn on call recording to record a voicemail.
  - Once the call is over, or other significant events occur, we send those events via web hook to a backend for recording.
        

# Event Logs

The script will POST events to the following HTTP Request Logger:
