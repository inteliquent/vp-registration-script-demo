# Voice Platform Script Demo
This repository contains information on how to attach a custom call flow Voice API script to a Voyant Phone Number.

# The Script
This script accomplishes the following use-case:
. We receive the inbound Call (LegA) and:
        ..* Play ringing in the background
        ..* Then, we Dial out to the SIP Endpoint for legB
        	...* When the user picks up, its either the voicemail, or a real person, so we ask them to press a Key to accept the call (using TTS)
        		....* If they press 1, then we join them to the Conference Room
        		....* If they donâ€™t press 1, then we terminate LegB and stop playing ringback, play the voicemail instructions using TTS, play a Beep, and turn on call recording to record a voicemail.
      	..* Once the call is over, or other significant events occur, we send those events via web hook to a backend for recording.
